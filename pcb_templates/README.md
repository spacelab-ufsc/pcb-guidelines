## Overview

The sources of the templates used in the SpaceLab projects are avalaible in this folder. Remember to check if your project uses the latest version of these templates. In order to add new formats and files, before their inclusion in this folder, create issues for analysis of the members involved hardware development.

## CAD Tools

The main CAD tool used in SpaceLab hardware developments is the Altium Designer (versions 18+). Contact the hardware members to get access to the license. Also, some older and simpler projects were developed using KiCad (open-source alternative).

## Notes

Remember to check the correct utilization of these templates in the [pcb_projects](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/pcb-standard/tree/master/pcb_projects) folder.
