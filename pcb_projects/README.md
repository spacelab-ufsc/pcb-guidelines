## Overview

This folder contain clean and base projects for future develpments. It has the required configuration and template utilization for SpaceLab projects. This scheme prevents errors and speed-up the development process, avoiding starting projects from scratch.

## How to start

	- Before starting, read the SpaceLab pcb_guidelines and pcb_standards.
	- then, select the proper template for your project (for same or similar use).
	- Copy its folder content and compile it for checking your CAD tool installation.
	- If it works without problems, rename the project and add the necessary files to it.
	- Update the libraries files, templates sources, git files, and output job file (if necessary).
	- Create your repository following the standards described in the pcb_guidelines.
	- Do your first commit, including this base generic hardware folder.
	- Start your board development.
	- If you find any problems or want to suggest modifications, create an issue.

## Examples

#### CubeSat module 2 layers (GomSpace Compliant)
To be done!

#### CubeSat module 4 layers (GomSpace Compliant)

The [pcb_cubesat_4layers](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/pcb-standard/tree/master/pcb_projects/pcb_cubesat_4layers) is designed for CubeSat modules. It is suitable for service and payload boards development. Also, it is compatible (dimensions and PC-104 specification) with the FloripaSat core and GomSpace modules (check if this remains true before starting).
